The WeatherApp project is an Android application developed using Java and XML within Android Studio. 
The primary objective of this project is to create a user-friendly weather application with two main pages: the main dashboard and the future forecast page.
The main dashboard serves as the landing page upon launching the application. 
It displays current weather information such as temperature, weather conditions, and possibly other relevant data such as humidity or wind speed. 
This information is presented in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format to enhance user experience.
Additionally, the main dashboard features interactive elements, including a "Next 7 Days" button, allowing users to access the future forecast page for an extended weather outlook. 
Furthermore, a back button is provided to navigate back to the main dashboard from the future forecast page seamlessly.
The future forecast page, accessed via the "Next 7 Days" button, provides users with a comprehensive overview of the weather forecast for the upcoming week. 
This page may display daily or hourly forecasts, depending on user preferences or design choices. 
Each forecast entry includes relevant details such as date, temperature range, weather conditions, and possibly additional information like precipitation probability.
To efficiently manage and display forecast data, the project implements RecyclerViews with custom adapters. 
The hourly forecast data is handled using an HourlyAdapter, while the daily forecast data is managed by a DailyAdapter. 
These adapters facilitate the dynamic display of forecast information in a scrollable and organized manner, enhancing the overall usability of the application.
In summary, the WeatherApp project focuses on creating a visually appealing and functional weather application for Android users. 
Through effective UI design and backend implementation, users can easily access current and future weather forecasts, enhancing their overall weather monitoring experience.
